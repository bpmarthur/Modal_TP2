Sure! Here's a breakdown of the corresponding command lines for the actions you performed in VS Code:

    Open your project folder (navigate to the project directory in the terminal):

cd path/to/your/repository

Check the current branch (make sure you're on the right branch, e.g., main):

git branch

This will show you the current branch you're on. The active branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).

Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

git fetch

Pull the latest changes from the remote repository (merge them into your local branch):

git pull origin main

Replace main with the correct branch name if you're working on a different branch.

Commit your local changes (if any): If you've made local changes and want to commit them:

    Stage your changes (add files to the commit):

git add .

or

git add <specific-file-name>

Commit your changes:

    git commit -m "Your commit message"

Push your changes to the remote repository (if you've committed changes):

    git push origin main

    Again, replace main with your branch name if needed.

These commands mirror the actions you would take through the VS Code interface! Let me know if you'd like more info.
